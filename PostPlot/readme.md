# Post Plot 

This program is identical in functionality to the Live Plot program, but with the live plotting capabilities removed (while I troubleshoot issues with live plotting on boards other than the Arduino Uno R3).

For information about how the program operates, see the Live Plot program (ignore parts for plotting live data).
